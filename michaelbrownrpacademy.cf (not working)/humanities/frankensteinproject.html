                Lets get to know things about Frankenstein. Frankenstein was a monster created by somebody made by the name of "Victor
                Frankenstein". 
                The monster never had a name or gotten a name, people always just called the monster Frankenstein. 
                Im going to call the monster just Frank since thats easier. 
            </p>
            <p style="color: white;">
                Frank was made from lightning and a body of connected human body parts. 
                When the creation of Frank was successful, Victor hated it because it was so ugly. 
                Frank was locked away for days. 
                When he escaped, he ran away. 
            </p>
            <p style="color:white;">
                Frank then killed William Frankenstein. 
                He then started killing some other people, including Victor's love, Elizabeth. 
                Frankenstein went on a search for Frank afterwards, for revenge. 
                Frank didn't feel like he belonged in the world. 
            </p>
            <p style="color:white;">
                Victor became cold then died. 
                Shortly after Frank came and visited Victor. 
                He explained that he would then burn himself, because Frank never belonged. 
                Then Frank burnt himself. 
            </p>
            <p style="color:white;">
                Thats the short story of Franks's lifetime in the novel of Frankenstein by Mary Shelley. 
                I tried my best of what i remembered from the novel.
