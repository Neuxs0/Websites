# Updates

I won't be updating the game consistently, it's just me and im still learning to code, so updates will take longer to come out.

# Who is working on this?

Currently I'm the only person working on this, Neuxs.

# How do i trust this is safe and not a virus?

In this site, you can see all the code included in this all of these games/apps. If you can't tell what code is dangerous or not, you could have somebody who can check the code.

# Why won't any of the .jar files run? 

Most of the time it's just becuase you dont have the lastest version of java installed.

# What do I do if I want to suggest something?

You can email me at NeuxsYT@gmail.com, if you want credit, don't worry! I will give credit to everyone who suggests something and I make it. Please put a way/name for me to credit you with.

# Why is it on github?

The official downloads are on [website not up yet] and here you can see the source code.
